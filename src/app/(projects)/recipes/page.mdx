### **Backend web app in using c# with .Net**

This is a little recipe sharing app which uses DotNet framework with c# and Razor pages for display.

It uses the MVC pattern and Identity Api for user functionality, using JWT for authentication also. I decided to stick with SQLite using Entity Framework Core for ORM.

I used image uploads to local with filepath uploads to database, on Delete all is removed at once. Images are handled with imagesharp package and set to a size on upload.

Descriptions for the recipes use markdown using the MarkDig package they are parsed in markdown format.
